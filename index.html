    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Four years ago, we didn’t know how much our lives were about to change.
What started as a simple connection slowly became something deeper, something real.

We learned each other in moments both loud and quiet  in laughter that filled the air, and in silence that spoke louder than words.

We grew. We stumbled. We chose each other again and again.
Not because it was easy, but because it was worth it.

Time tested us, strengthened us, and shaped us into something beautiful.
Four years later, here we are not perfect, but perfectly ours.

And if love is a journey, then this has only been the beginning.

    <h2>Barry to Letty</h2>
    <p>
      Letty,

If I could relive every moment with you, I would still choose the same path  every smile, every tear, every lesson.

You are my safe place in a loud world.
You are my calm when life gets heavy.

Loving you has taught me patience, strength, and what it truly means to care for another soul.
You have stood by me in ways words can never fully capture.

Four years with you feels like both a lifetime and a heartbeat.
And if the future is uncertain, there is one thing I know without doubt —
I want every tomorrow with you in it.

This is not just a celebration of time.
It’s a promise.

Always yours,
Barry    </p>
